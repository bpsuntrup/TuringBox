# TuringBox (WIP)
A turing machine emulator library.

# Building
Run `make`. This should output an executable called "TuringBox", which is
basically just a driver development purposes. Don't expect it to do
anything fancy right now. Maybe eventually it will be a nice demo...

# Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, they need to be compiled using c++11. pass the
`-std=c++11` switch to g++. Hopefully by the time anyone but me is interested
in using this, I'll have that all written into the Makefiles.
