# TuringBox

A "box" of turing machine programs. I like turing machines. I've always wanted
to write a turing machine program in C++, so I have a started ('failed') C++
Turing machine... I hate C++.

I have a couple of good python versions of Turing machine to satisfy my 
itch/boredom. Someday, I think it would be cool to equip them with advanced 
features like multi-threading, networking/etc. *Note:* that would be a bad
idea.
