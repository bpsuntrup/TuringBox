# TEST
A unit testing framework for ME for C++.

# Building
Run `make`. This will output a library in bin/ called `libtest.a`.

# TODO
Currently, a list of TODO's is maintained in TODO. In addition to what's listed
there, I need to document this code, make a separate repo for it, version it,
and think of a better name...
