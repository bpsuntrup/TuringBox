In order to get tests up and running, I'll need a small framework. Below are
things I'll need to do to have everything I need to test classes and stuff:

 - TestBed class
   - class that strings a bunch of TestCases together and runs them all
 - TestCase class
   - class that contains a bunch of test methods
 - Exceptions to be thrown for failing tests
